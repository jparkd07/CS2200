For jalr, what we can do is use two different instruction set to replace it. Suppose "target" is the address we need to get, we can do something like 
(a)lea $r0, 1
(b)beq $t0, $t0, target

Essentially we're using lea to save the return address (and use offset 1 since it'll want to return to the next line) and branching to target by using beq.
